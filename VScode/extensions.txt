GitLens (very nice tool for working with Git)
Live Sass Compiler (includes Live Server)
Prettier (code formatter for multiple languages)
Visual Studio IntelliCode (Intellisense for Python, TypeScript/JavaScript and Java)
Simple New File (enables creating files through the VScode command palette)
VSCode Great Icons (custom icons for 200+ file extensions)

Aside from those I use some language specific extensions for linting...
